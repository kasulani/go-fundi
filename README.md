<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Fundi is swahili word that means a skilled technical person, and it was the perfect word to choose for name for a 
tool to enable developers quickly scaffold a project and generate working code. Our initial focus is on `go` projects,
but we will expand the scope to include other programming languages.

Fundi scaffolds a project structure that contains `.go` files, with ready to use code, which can be used to quickly 
set up a working a REST api service, gRPC service or a CLI application, leaving the developer to focus their energy 
to hack away at the domain problem and provide a working prototype.

### Features
* Minimalistic code generation. We leave the domain design to you.
* Transparent and simple with a clear sight of coding. No magic!
* Uses clean code architecture (hexagonal)
* Ready to use components and middleware for distributed tracing and metrics
* Provisions ready to use infrastructure; linting, makefile, docker-compose, pre-commit, CI/CD and deployment.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
You need to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install). We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to add 
git hooks scripts that run checks automatically on `git commit` command.
After installing `pre-commit`, add the git hook scripts using the `pre-commit install` [command](https://pre-commit.com/#install).
Click [here](https://pre-commit.com/#usage) to learn more about `pre-commit`.
